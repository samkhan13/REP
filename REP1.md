REP1:

A composition within text, image, video or audio media, pertaining to any form of knowledge, may be stored and shared via a public repository without asserting any type of monetary burden upon the users for accessing the repository and its contents.

Author attributions and copyright licenses associated with a composition must ensure that the composition is perpetually free to retrieve, view, modify, copy and distribute for any purposes by any member of society.

An author, who pushes a composition to the repository may remain anonymous via an alias.

The privilege of critiquing a composition must not be denied to any member of society under any circumstances.

A "corresponding author" is expected to moderate the comments pertaining to their composition only after the comment has been posted in a publicly visible section of the repository.

A comment about a composition is also a composition amenable to REP.

Should a composition contain spam, pornography, hate speech, slurs or other abusive content, the content may be flagged and subsequently "hidden" via a public consensus of at least 3 members who flag the content. Such content may be eliminated from the repository upon a consensus of any 128 members. The concept of hidden content is that the content can be viewed upon a manual action by a person, who thus consents to getting exposed to the content. It is in the best interest of the community and for highlighting valuable compositions, to avoid reposting exasperating content.

A composition may also be protected from further editing and remain in public domain via a consensus of any 32 members. Naturally, a copy of it may be edited.
